* Code "properness"
* Think about maps vs unordered_maps
* Evaluation message should delete sketch that contains
* See how to make SketchMonitor derive from another, more easily.
* Fix reports & so on so that they are generic to the type of summary
* CoreEvaluation --> core from list to set
* Reorder TrustedAuthority.cpp
* Think a better approach for the Robust flooding (do not have pointers to Report in two different places)
* Class CoreSummary
* Make sure that Report does not have a memory leak because of summary_var --> there is no delete.
* Optimized bytes to bits
* Order imports
