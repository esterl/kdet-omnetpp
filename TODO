* Rename ReliableFlooding to RobustFlooding
* Sketches as a library
* Robust flooding --> eliminar aquellos "sketches" viejos
* Code "properness"
* Think about using signature as ID on the flooding
* Think about maps vs unordered_maps
* Change find --> count in maps
* TODO baseSketch should be unmodifiable; --> e.g. get already gives you a copy.
* Unify addr and address
* Evaluation message should delete sketch that contains
* IP as ints instead of strs.
* See how to make SketchMonitor derive from another, more easily.
* Fix TTL and report ID @ robustflooding
* Naming everywhere (report --> owner)
* Document
* Fix reports & so on so that they are generic to the type of summary
* GraphServer IP str --> int
* Flooding --> finish
* CoreEvaluation --> core from list to set
* Remove from ReportIdMsg id
* Reorder FakeFlooding.*
