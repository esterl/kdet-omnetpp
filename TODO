* Sketches as a library
* Code "properness"
* Think about maps vs unordered_maps
* Unify addr and address --> addr
* Evaluation message should delete sketch that contains
* See how to make SketchMonitor derive from another, more easily.
* Naming everywhere (report --> owner)
* Fix reports & so on so that they are generic to the type of summary
* Flooding --> finish
* CoreEvaluation --> core from list to set
* Fix memory leak ip routes
* Reorder TrustedAuthority.cpp
* Migrate to INET 3.0
* Flooding base class
* Fix header files
* Think a better approach for the Robust flooding (do not have pointers to Report in two different places)
* Class CoreSummary
* Document
* Configurable whether to randomize or not interval duration
